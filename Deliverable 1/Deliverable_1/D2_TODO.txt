To Fix from D1 based on TA Comments:
( ) View Animal
    ( ) Integer values displayed (translate them to strings)
    ( ) Implementation could be cleaner
            ex: SQL queries inside mainwindow.cpp (make a function inside database)
( ) Add Animal
    (X) After adding animal to db perhaps reset the form
    ( ) allows to add animals with empty information
    ( ) allows to add animal with ID so large it won't be displayed
