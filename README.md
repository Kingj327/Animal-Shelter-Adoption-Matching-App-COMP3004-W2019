## General Info
This was an Animal Adoption Matching App created using Qt (C++). It was a group project in which I ended up completing around 80% of the code, while being heavily involved in the overall design of the code/document.

Instructions on how to run the code should be in the folder. The code does work still, however I've included photos of the application so no one has to download it to run it.
