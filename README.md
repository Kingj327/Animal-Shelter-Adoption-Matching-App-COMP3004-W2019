## General Info
This was an Animal Adoption Matching App created using Qt (C++). It was a group project in which 2 of the 4 members were reatively useless in its completion. As such, I completed around 80-90% of the code, while my friend completed a fair portion of the document requirements, and we were both involved in the overall design of the code/document.

Instructions on how to run the code should be in the folder. The code does work still, however I've included photos of the application so no one has to downlaod it to run it.
